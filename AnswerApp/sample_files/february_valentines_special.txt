February (Valentines Special)
Word of welcome from our Directors!
Hello everyone, and belated Happy Valentine‚Äôs Day üíå! We‚Äôre thrilled to bring to you our first monthly English2Success newsletter issue, where we aim to keep you up to date about our news and events, and provide a platform to publish the beautiful works of our talented E2S members.
‚Äç
E2S started out as an online teaching initiative for underprivileged kids around the world, and, over time, grew to become a huge community of more than 400 members spanning across over 70 countries and 11 schools. We have seen students improving their English, tutors gaining valuable teaching experience, and most importantly, friendships formed and personal growth through cultural exchange.

We hope these newsletters can be a space for you to learn more about the program and each other outside of the lessons and school gatherings, to share your journeys and any creative works that you‚Äôre proud of, be it short stories, book reviews, poems, or just anything you can think of!

This month‚Äôs theme, in celebration of Valentine‚Äôs Day, will be about üíïüí≠üìñüé∂üî¨ ~ Our lovely newsletter team (Nikolina, Lenia, Balqis, and Lois) has written and put together book and song recommendations, as well as an intriguing explanation of the science behind love. You can also learn more about the experiences of some of our students and tutors through Tasneem and Charles‚Äô testimonials.

Student Testimonial by Tasneem (ÿ™ÿ≥ŸÜ€åŸÖ)
Greetings, I'm Tasneem and I'm a student from Afghanistan. Currently, I'm a student in the E2S program, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills.

First, I heard about E2S from one of my buddies, and out of curiosity, I decided to apply. When I got accepted into this program, I didn't know what to expect, but then when my tutor messaged me, I was excited and I thought, ‚ÄúOh god that would be great!" That's how our journey started.

When I first met him, I was a little bit nervous, but over time, my tutor and I have shared great learning experiences together. We read books, watched movies and had insightful conversations about UWC and many other topics. During this journey I‚Äôve learned many new and effective ways to improve my English.

Our discussions go beyond just learning. He has become more like a friend to me, and someone I can feel free to talk to. It has been one of the best learning experiences I‚Äôve had.

Now I want to take the moment to thank the E2S founders, who have given us this opportunity. I also deeply appreciate my tutor's support and guidance, and it has made a huge difference in my learning journey.

Tutor Testimonial by Charles Li (China -- UWC Atlantic ‚Äò24)
Hello! I‚Äôm Charles, a recent graduate from UWC Atlantic College. Education has always been a huge passion of mine, and I‚Äôve always enjoyed the process of exchanging knowledge. In my spare time, I love sharing my hobbies, such as pottery and music production, with my friends. I always envisioned becoming a teacher in the future, even though I‚Äôm still unsure what I might teach. However, I knew that I wanted to gain experience. So when I heard about E2S from my bestie, I immediately knew that I wanted to be part of the program.
‚Äç
I was extremely nervous when I had to ‚Äúteach‚Äù my first ‚Äúlesson,‚Äù and even now, I sometimes panic while preparing materials for the next session. However, I was extremely fortunate to be paired up with the most ambitious and patient tutee. I always get advice on what I should teach next, different book recommendations, and even different teaching methods I should try. In lessons, we would cover topics like popular phrases in American English, how we should spend our holidays, and next week, we are planning on watching a movie together. Honestly, it feels more like having a friend. Sometimes the meeting extends an extra thirty minutes as we chat and satisfy our curiosities about each other‚Äôs stories, cultures and passions. Education is a process of continuous exchange, and I am only at the beginning of my path.

"Love Chemicals are in the air!" by Nikolina Gvozdenoviƒá (Montenegro -- UWC Adriatic ‚Äò25)
If love were to be reduced to hormones, mere chemical substances within human bodies that carry messages from one organ to the other, would it still be special?
‚Äç
Adrenaline is produced in the adrenal glands. They look like small triangles, located at the top of each kidney. These glands also produce cortisol, commonly referred to as the stress hormone, and noradrenaline, which are often forgotten by the general audience (Cleveland Clinic, 2022a). These three hormones are responsible for nervousness and panic when it comes to love. This does not mean you should blame your kidneys if you are too afraid to invite your crush out. However, if you do manage to find courage for it, and end up having the best date in the history of dates, your hypothalamus might be the one to thank.

The hypothalamus is a region located deep within the brain. It is connected to the pea-sized pituitary gland. Although small, this gland is responsible for some of the most important bodily functions. It also stores and releases oxytocin, a hormone responsible for the feelings of love and connection, which has been released by the hypothalamus. Apart from producing oxytocin, the hypothalamus is also responsible for producing dopamine, a hormone associated with pleasure and motivation (Cleveland Clinic, 2022a).

Truth be told, these two hormones do not act alone in bringing you the gift of love. After all, love is far from simple, both psychologically and physiologically. The pituitary gland creates endorphins, hormones typically used by the human body to protect itself from stress and pain (no one said love is easy). Produced during exercise, eating, and massage, these hormones get mixed up with the others to bring happiness to those who have fallen in love (Cleveland Clinic, 2022b).

It is marvelous how this emotion is simply a cocktail of hormones produced by the brain. The real question though is why the brain is producing these chemicals - is there perhaps something in the air?

Some would say love, but it would be rather hard to disperse all of the previously mentioned hormones into the air. Even so, that does not mean there are none. Most often those who know about pheromones, know about them because of the bees who use these chemicals to communicate, making them an intrinsic part of a colony‚Äôs life. Humans produce them, presumably in skin glands, as well. They can be smelled by another human being, although it is highly unlikely anyone would be able to tell what the specific scent of pheromones is, and that is why they are a part of communication between individuals (Grammer et al., 2005).

Some researchers claim that because of this scent plays an important role in choosing not just partners, but friends as well. It is rather curious how a bunch of chemicals can influence someone‚Äôs social life without them even realising it. That is why the next time someone tells you, ‚ÄúLove is in the air‚Äù you should be kind enough to let them know that it is probably not love, but pheromones.Do not let this discourage you from love though. Just because you know how it works, does not mean that you cannot still enjoy it!

Book Recommendation: Looking For Alaska by Lemonia (Lenia) Ioannidou (Greece -- LPCUWC ‚Äò25)
There is no better way to familiarise yourself with a language than immersing yourself in its literature! The purpose of this section is to introduce books that are written originally in English but nonetheless are easy to understand for someone who is not a native speaker. The focus of this newsletter will be the book ‚ÄúLooking for Alaska‚Äù by John Green.

In "Looking for Alaska," John Green tells the story of Miles Halter, a socially awkward teenager who seeks adventure and meaning before leaving for boarding school. There, he encounters a cast of vibrant characters, including the enigmatic Alaska Young, who captivates him with her wild spirit and intellect. As Miles navigates friendship, love, and loss, he grapples with the idea of "the Great Perhaps"‚Äîa quest for purpose and understanding in life. The novel beautifully captures the complexities of becoming an adult, highlighting themes of friendship, identity, and the impact of loss.

John Green is an excellent author for teenagers beginning to learn English due to his engaging storytelling and relatable characters. His language is accessible yet rich, making it easier for learners to grasp both vocabulary and sentence structure. Green‚Äôs use of dialogue reflects how teenagers speak, allowing readers to connect more intimately with the narrative. Additionally, his themes of identity, friendship, and self-discovery resonate with young people, providing both emotional depth and valuable life lessons. Through his friendly and thoughtful prose, Green invites readers into a world of exploration and understanding, making the experience of learning English enjoyable and meaningful.

Other enjoyable reads by John Green would be the best seller novel ‚ÄúThe fault in our stars‚Äù and the book ‚ÄúLet it snow‚Äù. All of these books mentioned have also become movies that have gained lots of popularity!
