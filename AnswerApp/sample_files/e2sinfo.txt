About E2S
English2Success is a voluntary teaching initiative aiming to provide quality online English education for underprivileged teens worldwide.
English knowledge is important to access global opportunities to improve one’s circumstances. If people from developing countries improve their circumstances, hopefully, they will improve their families’ circumstances, and eventually, their entire communities.

However, most students from developing or under-developed countries do not have access to good English education. E2S has been developed as a solution.

Our objectives:
• Provide students with free, no-strings-attached English education.
• Increase students’ exposure to and confidence in speaking English.
• Foster cross-cultural understanding.
• Develop tutors’ teaching skills.

E2S Contributes towards UN sustainable development goals.
E2S Contributes Towards UN sustainable development goals #4 and #10.

#4 Quality Education: The main goal of E2S is to provide quality education to the communities that need it the most.
#10 Reduced Inequalities: In addition to only recruiting students from refugee backgrounds or developing countries, we prioritize the people that we believe need it the most. This year, many of our students are girls from Afghanistan, Laos, India etc.
